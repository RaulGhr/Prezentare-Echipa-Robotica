                  The summer before the new season, our team was invited by “Hamilton Central Europe” to participate at their bastion dedicated to technology at the “Flight Festival” 2019, the first edition of this event, at Timisoara on the 27th-29th of September. This was a great opportunity for us to meet new people and engage them in the STEM education and in our competition and maybe an opportunity for gathering some sponsorships.

                </p>
                <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
                  We started the preparation for this event pretty early, so that everything could fall in place once we were there. To announce our coming at the big event, our Alumni, put together a short presentation video about our team. 

                </p>  
                <h5>FIRST DAY OF THE FLIGHT FESTIVAL</h5>  
                <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
                  We arrived there and started preparing ourselves for the day. The people started coming and asking questions about the competition, the little kids played games on the Arcade and controled the robot and by the evening more and more people came to take gifs at our photo booth. The first day was amazing, full of joy and happiness!

                </p>  
                <h5>SECOND DAY OF THE FLIGHT FESTIVAL</h5>  
                <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
                  It was kind of the same, with people coming and asking questions and having fun with us. The surprise of the day were some Hamilton balloons that we got to give to the people. 

                </p>   
                <h5>THIRD DAY OF THE FLIGHT FESTIVAL</h5> 
                <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
                  This was the last day of the festival and we won’t lie, we were a little bit sad that this amazing experience was ending. Like the days before, everything went well, with a lot of people coming and being interested in our work. When we left, we truly shared some tears with team CSH, but we were so happy that we spend time with them.

              <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
                This event started as a thought, how could we do something that would have an impact in the society by finding solutions to real-life problems, while also getting teams from all around the globe to collaborate with each other and to form new friendships.
              </p>
              <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
                We immediately thought about a live discussion that could be seen live and in which everyone that: wanted could be a part of, but we didn't know any platforms that could sustain that many people video- chatting at the same time.

              </p>    
              <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
                The second idea that we had was to simply contact three more teams from around the globe and to only have the live discussion with them and to answer the answers from the chat. It was a fine idea and we could easily do that, but we would have lost the authenticity and creativity of the event, transforming it into an ordinary one.

              </p>    
              <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
                After some days of intense thinking, Catălin came up with a brilliant idea, to make to participants collaborate in order to solve problems that were a real threat to the environment and for the planet. His inspiration for this came from an event that former members of our team participated at called Youth Elite, at which teams of 10 would be given a specific place for a possible company that would help the cmmunity in a way or another.

              </p>    
              <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
                To get to this idea, he, at first, searched for international days with a meaning that we could use as the main theme of the event, with the closest one being the International Day of Science for Peace and Development, But we had three main issues.

              </p>    
              <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
                The first one was what would the theme have to do, as a robot would be quite hard to build and we were also going to start the season very soon, so the focus of the participants wasn't going to be on the event, but on their own robots for the competition. Then, the solution came to us, the goal of each team would be to designi a robat on the theme of Science for Peace and Development and to present it. The design of the robot would have to be illustrated at leas with a drawing or with a 3D model.

              </p>    
              <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
                The second problem actually was the presentation, as we realized that talking about each project, the way the idea came to each of the teams, how the robot would look like and about how it worked would be really hard, especially if we would do it live, so, we decided to let each of the teams present their idea in video that was going be uploaded on a Youtube channel created for the event.

              </p>    
              <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
                The last problem was how to get more than ten teams into an event like this, as teri teams seemed to us as a reasonable number for the first event of this type. Knowing that the robot would be presented into prerecorded videos, we decided to extend the event from one day, as we iriitially intended to make it last, to an entire week, posting a video every day.

              </p>    
              <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
                Another thing that we had to be careful at was that, if we invited teams from all around the globe, there would be a big time difference between same of them and it could cause a lot of problems. To avoid that, we decided that each video was going to be done by two teams that didn't have a difference bigger than three hours between their countries. With that done, the only thing we needed in arder to transform this event into reality was 13 more enthusiastic teams from around the globe that were willing to take part in this event.

              After the last day of Xeo Summer School we had a meeting and we discussed about XeoTalks. This year we wanted to be bigger than last year and we start thinking about it 2 months before. We wanted to keep the idea of the last year with conferences about different subjects that can make everyone learn new things. 

              </p>
              <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
              We needed to decide which dates the events should take place and to keep the tradition alive, we wanted to make the event in the last weekend of October 25th-27th so we could organized a Halloween party too.

              </p>        
              <h5>FIRST DAY</h5>
              <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
              We started the day really excited. We packed all the things we needed at the event and went to the university where the event took place, which is also where this year we made reception of the teams.

              </p>    
              <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
              We started with a brief presence of all teams that were in Alba Iulia for Xeo Talks, 29 teams and more than 170 people.

              </p>    
              <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
              The opening celebration of the event was held where we joined Mr. Daniel Breaz Rector of the University “1 Decembrie 1918”, Corina Rotar  Dean of the Faculty of accurate and Engineering sciences at the University “1 Decembrie 1918” and Mr. Liviu Stanciu, representative of the municipality of Alba Iulia.

              </p>    
              <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
              After the officials, teams could had the opportunity to visit Alba Iulia through a treasure hunt organized in the Alba Carolina fortress that they all managed to complete it.

              </p>    
              <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
              At the end of the day, we organized at our high school discussions about the following season. Some tips and tricks about sponsors, money for the team and events organized by teams.

              </p>    
              <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
              There were simultaneous discussions about technical and non-tehnical part. There were also some ideas about new theme season Skystone. 

              </p>    
              <h5>THE SECOND DAY</h5>
              <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
              The main day was the conferences day. We all together to learn new things from people who wanted to share some of their experience and give us some tips that could help us through life.

              </p>    
              <h5>LEADERSHIP- MARIUS BÎCU</h5>
              <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
              Even if we do robots and Marius Bîcu is the owner of a company who produce cheese, we thought that there is actually a common point.  It was a speech dedicated to leaders of the teams who have to be always impartial and see the best solutions for his team.

              </p>   
              <h5>PUBLIC SPEAKING-CĂTĂLINA MOLEAVIN</h5> 
              <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
              Cătălina came to teachs us some tips about how to speak easily in public. She helped u show to control our emotions during an interview, what’s right to do and say and what’s not.

              </p>    
              <h5>TEAMWORK- ANDREI AVRAM</h5>
              <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
              Yeti came to speak about teamwork. Being in a team is probably harder than you thought, because you have to compare different ideas to understand that sometimes your ideea is not always the best. 

              </p>    
              <h5>STORY OF XEO</h5>
              <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
              We also wanted to have a special moment when we could talk about our journey throught three season of the competiton. To tell everyone what would we have done better in these years and what we learned.

              </p>  
              <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
              Because of that, we let the founders of Xeo to talk about it. Like any team we faced problems, but being together, we managed to overcome them. Because after all, as we like to say, Xeo is more than just a team, Xeo is a family.

              </p>      
              <h5>MENTORSHIP-  GABRIELA ALEXANDRU</h5>
              <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
              Gabriela talked about mentorship by being a teacher. Even if the speech was destinated to our mentors, we are all mentors in our lives with our family and friends.

              </p>    
              <h5>NEUROMARKETING- CRINA LUHA</h5>
              <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
              Crina talked about neuromarketing, which is not a pretty common subject because it is not that marked in our daily lives. For teams was an interesting subject because we learned how to promote our team and make it more visual for public.

              </p>    
              <h5>HALLOWEEN PARTY</h5>
              <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
              After a long day everyone deserves a break so it’s time for Halloween Party!  Even if we said at first that the costumes are not mandatory, a lot of people came dressed as different caracters. 

              </p>    
              <h5>THE THIRD DAY</h5>
              <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
              We started the day with our special guest, Cazacu Alexandru, who helped us with a Creo and AR workshop. 

              </p>    
              <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
              After the workshop as we mentioned at the closing ceremony, we wanted to premiere our sponsors from the father season. Then it followed the awarding of participating teams. And finally, we wanted to say a few words to all the people who for 3 days were joining us and attended our event!

            1st of December is the National Day of Romania, and it firstly took place at Alba Iulia, so Xeo decided to organized a fundraising event for a child support center called “Sfânta Maria”, to make a brighter and a happier Saint Nicholas Day for them.

            </p>    
            <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
            The event was held at our local mall, from 12 om to 6 pm, an awesome day that took a lot of preparation. We spoke with a few teams to help us organized a scrimmage for the cause. Teams CSH, Rubix and Cyberpunk agreed to join and compete for children.

            </p>    
            <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
            At 12pm, people started to come around and take a look. Our first matches were warm-ups to see if our robots are ready to compete one against the other and to get to know each other better, us with the people and the children who came around. 

            </p>    
            <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
            The children that gatherd around our field were mesmerized, watching the robot’s every move very carefully, their parents asking our volunteers about FTC competition, our team’s origins and how big the community is.

            </p>    
            <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
            Xeo Academy also helped us by having their robot on show, giving a small presentation about their team and they had a small workshop for children. Robotics themed coloring pages and Christmas ornaments were ready to be painted by the youngest ones.s

            </p>    
            <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
            As a conclusion, the event was absolutely delightful, we succeeded to earn enogh to help the children in need and we managed to form new relationships between the people and the community and between the teams.

          After we organized Secret Santa last year between us we started to think that it would be a great idea to take this to the next level. What is the next level? Making a Secret Santa with all the teams from Romania participating in BRD FIRST Tech Challenge.

          It's been a while since we dropped the idea of "#XeoSecretSanta", but we had a little problem: Who will extract the teams randomly without anyone knowing the pairs that are formed?

          </p>    
          <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
          This was the same problem that we had this season at our Secret Santa between team members. Because more than a half of us are at University they can not be there when the pairs will be randomly selected. And then, Mihai came with the solution -a site called secretsantaorganizer.com

          What is secretsantaorganizer.com?It's a free online Secret Santa gift exchange organizer / Kris Kringle generator! You can organize a Secret Santa party with your friends, family or even your co-workers. After receiving the Secret Santa mail you can add your own wishlist, which will be delivered to your Secret Santa.

        We improved it and did it for the second time. From 24.02.2020 to 28.02.2020 we planned to go to the schools in our city and spread the ideas of FIRST and explain what a robotics team does and how we make our robots from the beginning till the end, and for diversity, we also explained to the children about our events, how plan them and how we make them work.

        We started the week with two presentations at the college “Dorin Pavel” and at the “Mihai Eminescu” school. We were nervous, but with time we got the hang of doing the presentation and started to be better at them minute by minute.

        </p>    
        <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
        We followed on with “Vasile Goldis” school on Tuesday where some children already knew about us and were very excited about us coming to their school and learning more about us and the competition we participated at.

        </p>    
        <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
        Our journey continued till Friday, going from school to school and telling our story from the beginning till the present, our highs and lows but most importantly that we didn’t reach the point where we are today only doing robots, we made friends for life, we grew together and we smiled through hard and easy times. The last school was “Ion Agarbiceanu” where between presentations we participated at one of their breaks where everyone along the hallway was standing near their friends and reading books.It was a full week of exploring, meeting passionate students and learning new things while doing what we love.

      Starting with the idea that mental health amongst teenagers is very important and uncared for, we decided to create an event especially designed for youngsters that focused around this theme. Since the team functions with children between the ages of 16 and 18, this event would be beneficial for both us and the adolescents that live in Alba Iulia and close by.

      </p>    
      <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
      The idea began with a little talk after a meeting between the team members about the state of mind of nowadays teenagers and how stress and peer pressure affects all of us. The main problem is that students are under a lot of stress lately and that plays a big part in the day to day life. School life, what happens back home, extracurricular activities, competitions, all of these have a powerful impact over the life of young adults and sometimes it can all be too much for someone who is still developing.

      <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
      After a long  thought process, we decided to get in touch with the psychologist from “1 Decembrie  1918” University so that a professional could guide us and aid us when it comes to these sort of things.

      </p>    
      <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
      This was an event that succeeded in improving the mental state of high school students. Our main goal- to be able to proudly say that having a mental issue isn’t something out of the orinary, that it can be fixed with a little bit of help and going to a professional isn’t shameful.

      We started with the idea that health is always the priority. So for us and those around us to be healthy, it takes sacrifices, sometimes small, sometimes bigger. This time the gesture made by us is a small one but with a great meaning. Knowing that the blood donation department in Alba Iulia has no stable resources, that they always need more, we mobilized our team and we took a day to go and donate blood. At the same time, we tried to start a campaign named “#PutemSalvaVieti” on this topic, among all the robotics teams participating in the BRD FIRST Tech Challenge Romania competition so that each of them goes to their city and donate blood. Certain conditions must be met, we have gone many, but only our colleague Alex has managed to fulfill them all and to donate some of his blood. The nurses were very happy to see how eager we are to donate so we assured them that the next time we go, there will be more of us prepared for the donation.

      We began our trip to Cluj on Thursday, the day before the Cluj Qualifying Tournament would begin so that we would be able to prepare properly for what would be coming up next. Three of our trusted mechanics and one of our non-technical girls gladly took the opportunity and geared up so that a beautiful pit would be up and ready to go for the upcoming days. We finished right on time, at 9 o’clock when everything would close down so that the volunteers could get every single task down and ready to go for Friday.

      </p>    
      <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
      The first day of the Qualifying Tournament has arrived. The energy was at maximum and since this was the beginning for a big part of this year’s team, the element of surprise was persistent. The first task of the day was to get settled down, get everything up and running, our engineering notebooks, the little surprises we’ve created for the teams, the promotional materials that our graphic designers made and of course, the robot had to be in top shape for the next two days. After a short “energizer” and a moment of affection that helped us get rid of our fears, we began our work the proper way.

      </p>    
      <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
      A few of us grouped up and along with our mascot, we started visiting each team’s pit. With our pockets full of stickers and pins, the day began. Interacting with the teams present was a must so what better way to do it rather than taking pictures, filling our mascot with each team’s pin or sticker, getting contacts, start new friendships and just simply, talking, telling stories and reminiscing on the beautiful moments lived during FTC.

      </p>    
      <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
      Once 12 o’clock hit, we all gathered around our pit to get ready for the interview. Eight out of nineteen members got excited and got the energy flowing for the upcoming 10 minutes. We prepared our robot, engineering notebook and brochure and took them to cabin number two. We were all nervous but it quickly faded away when we first met the judges. Three kind but tough people that welcomed us with open arms. The “Q&A” went by so fast since we were truly prepared for anything that would be thrown towards us.

      </p>    
      <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
      It was time to take a breather and prepare for the robot and field inspections, both passed successfully. We were asked by some of the people from Natie Prin Educatie to play a few matches for the referees to train one last time. We played about four matches that were a perfect training for us too. Advice was given and new friendships were formed. With a little bit more training, we were definitely ready for the day that would be coming next.

      </p>    
      <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
      It has happened in such way that we made it to the second day of the tournament, yet nobody knows how, but we are grateful for it anyway. We started off the day by attending the opening ceremony, presented by the one and only Dana Războiu, the head of the Nație prin Educație association, responsible for organizing and hosting the FTC competition in Romania. Let’s not forget about the main host and commentator, Doru Cătănescu, a very charming and charismatic man who made us the honour to take a photo with him.

      </p>    
      <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
      Then, the games started. In this day of the tournament, we had to play 4 qualification matches, the last two ones being scheduled for the last day, on Sunday. We played the 8, 15, 22 and 33 qualification matches, out of which we lost the 22 one unfortunately. On the 8th game we teamed up with ABSO-Tech against Robopeda and StarTech. On the 15th one we shared the alliance with RoboAS against Trojan.EXE and RoboPapiu, on the 22nd one, which we lost, we were with SNGine against IDeaL Electronics and Perpetuum Mobile. Then we had a well deserved lunch break, which was followed by our last game in that day. It was us and Hardwired against CNapSys and Clever Core. We wish to give congratulations to all the teams that we had the opportunity to play against and alongside!

      </p>    
      <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
      It was a very exciting and day and full of events, full of cheerness, love, fun and moments we may never forget. A loaded day was waiting for us, as Sunday was the day in which we would play our last games and find out whether we won any award, hopefully.

      </p>    
      <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
      And so… Sunday came, the final day. We managed to get to the semi-finals, an exciting moment we’ve been waiting for. Our hearts were beating fast, nervousness coursing through our veins, but the energy at maximum level. Unfortunately, we lost, but our spirit was still there. We cheered for the other teams until the last match was played. 

      </p>    
      <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
      The Award Ceremony came next. We all gathered around the main stage to prepare for what was going to be thrown at us. Fear, joy, excitement, curiosity, these were a few from the blend of emotions that we were feeling. And then we heard: “Inspire Award 2nd place goes to… Team RO001 Xeo form Alba Iulia”. We didn’t even have time to realize what was going on but we were up and running in no time. We couldn’t stop smiling! :)) It was the moment that made us grateful for what we achieved. 

      </p>    
      <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
      The regional competition met its end. It was time to head home. A 2 hour drive filled with laughter, memories and beautiful people celebrating together. Once we arrived at our final destination, our highschool, a surprise waited for us there. Our beloved Xeo Academy were there, waiting for us, with all the positivity to congratulate us. 

      </p>    
      <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
      And as a conclusion, it’s quite easy for us to sum it up: The best is yet to come, I know, you know, that we've only just begun, through the highs and lows.

      </p>    ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎

      On the 29th of February, 2020, a unique day that occurs only every 4 years, we organized one of our most ambitious events of this season, The Xeo Scrimmage, long for TXS. It was comprised of a series of demonstrative matches, attended by 16 teams in total, approximated to around 180 people and besides this, an hour-long conference about everything that has to do with the FTC world, from technical advice to stuff linked to the engineering notebook and marketing & design advice as well. All the information had been provided by our wonderful guests, Dan Gaidău and Robert Sîrbu, two very experienced personalities that have volunteered for Nație Prin Educație for many years.

      </p>    
      <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
      We’ll start a day early, on the 28th. This was the day dedicated to preparations, getting ready for everybody and everything. The promotional materials were ready to go, to be distributed to all the teams. The place where all this madness would take place was our high school’s gym, a huge and tall room, with seats on one side, perfect to admire the games that would take place just in the middle, as it would be normal. We tested the sonorization to make sure everything sounded right. The tables and the chairs were all put up in place, and the conference room, “The room of mirrors” as we like to call it, got all set up as well, with over 100 chairs so we could fit in as many people as possible.

      </p>    
      <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
      The following day was the day of the event. Early in the morning, everybody was present at 7 o'clock because we still had a lot of work to do, and the most important part of all was warmly welcoming the teams to our scrimmage. Together with our lovely colleagues from Xeo Academy, we managed to prepare the portfolios for everybody, a little snack stand, and the game fields. Teams started to roll in, to make themselves comfortable. An opening ceremony marked the official start of TXS. Slowly, each arrived team was called to the technical inspection (our technical chief, Besi, was in charge, of course). Fortunately, everybody had passed in one way or another, and they soon started to get ready for the games. A total of 22 games had been played, out of which every team had good a outcome. Of course we had a break as well, that occurred at halftime. It was time for the lunch, and we gave every team free hot meals, thanks to our sponsors who managed to make this possible. 

      </p>    
      <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
      After the lunch break, the highlight of TXS happened. We guided everybody to the conference room, where they were awaited by our guests, Dan and Robert, ready to be shot at with tons of questions. They were happy to present themselves, and then the discussion started. It was mostly a session of Q&A, to which some of our alumni were happy to join, and discussed themes such as design and the engineering notebook. This proved to be extremely productive and effective, mainly because people didn’t hesitate to join the discussion and made it even more interesting than we thought it would be. Also, our past engineering notebooks went from hand to hand and were studied by the other students, so they could analyse our progress and maybe get some ideas on how to improve or change theirs.

      </p>    
      <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
      The conference ended, and the matches continued. We were impressed by the progress that other teams managed to do since the Regional Tournament, and it really got us working harder. The atmosphere was great, as we would have wanted. Before starting the semi-finals, there was a break, in which we managed to create a flash mob, and everybody joined and started dancing with us. In the end, the finals arrived, and the alliances that fought against each other were as follows: IDeaL Electronics(captain) and Herotech(1st pick) against Cyberpunk(captain) and Rutherbots(1st pick). The winning alliance proved to be the one comprised of IDeaL Electronics and Herotech, which we wish to congratulate and nothing but further success.   

      </p>    
      <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
      Every team that took part to this event gets our sincere congratulations, because after all the main objective of the event was to create a great energy and everybody have a good time. Thank you everybody for allowing this to happen, because this event wouldn’t have been nothing without you, and you create this wonderful community in which we are grateful to live and be an active part of!

      From 2nd of july to 9th  we participated at esentza summer camp, a place where we gathered around with other teams from FTC Romania.

      </p>    
      <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
      In the first day we arrived at Beclean, the place where Esentza Robotics was born, and were welcomed by an Esentza member that was going to be a volunteer for our team, after which we participated at the opening ceremony where we received our programs badges. The rest of the day was dedicated to making friends and getting to know each other.

      </p>    
      <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
      The second day was opened with some tips & tricks offered by the competition’s organizers, this way, opening the demo competition between the present teams. 

      </p>    
      <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
      In the third day we get sorted out by groups and start our courses: robot Assembly / 3D Modelling in Creo and Motivational Coach. More than that we had an Input from Natie prin Educatie  with more tips & tricks. \

      </p>    
      <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
      The fifth day started with a surprise, we were tooken to a balnear spa park.After dinner, during the same day, our team along Quantum Robotics and Technogods, got the opportunity to share our experience at the First World Championship Detroit. We told them about how the people were, what American judges focused on during the competitions and many other tips & tricks that we learned.

      </p>    
      <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
      The sixth was a pretty relaxed one, where participants followed the same workshop schedule.

      </p>    
      <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
      The last day everyone seemed a little bummed about it, some teams also leaving early, not being able to enjoy the last activities. That day everyone presented their prototypes of the robots that they worked on and the 3D models. We weren’t lucky enough on neigher of the competitions but this camp really helped us learn important tips.

      On the 8th-9th of February, we attended an event at Oradea created by Modus Vivendi. We came to Oradea by the train and ended up there by 11 am, a few hours before the beginning of the conferences. But before that, we had some fun games and activities that helped us bound more with the other teams and helped us make new friends. And also we visited the Citadel of Oradea.

      On the 20th of June, we received an invitation from a volunteer from BRD FIRST Tech Challenge Romania called Ştefan Tănasă to participate at the launch of a new FTC team in Barlad, named Inorog Team. He told us that we were going to appear on a local TV news program and at that we also had to play some matches to show the public the competition.

      </p>    
      <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
      Few days later, we were in Bârlad for the live interview, at which we let Cătălin talk, this being his first one. We were welcomed there by Cătălin Angheluță, one of the mentors of inorog Team and by Ştefan Tanasă, the volunteer from BRD FIRST Tech Challenge that invited us to the event, both of wham would accompany us at the interview and at the rest of the events around the weekend.

      </p>    
      <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
      The rest of the day passed pretty quickly, we went to a restaurant and talked with the guests about the official launch of their team that was going to start the next day at 10 A.M. and at which 3 more teams were going to participate and present to the audience parts of the competition and how they came in contact with it, while we were going to present our entire story and how we managed to qualify for the World Championship.

      </p>    
      <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
      The main day of our trip came, we went to the National Highschool "Gheorghe Roşca Codreanu", the school where the launch was going to take place. There, we met with three other teams from the region,

      </p>    
      <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
      Team Inorog started the presentation, presenting themselves, their ideas, goals, their way to be and their plans for the future, then, we saw their registration video and it was actually very enthusiastic, creative and funny, we were very glad to see that.

      </p>    
      <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
      Then, the time for the other teams came to make their presentations, they talked about team spirit, the values of FIRST, about making a robot and about organizing events. After than, our time came, we tried to sum up all the other presentations and to include therm in our story summary, making use of them when we were talking about how we are constantly trying to upgrade our robot, about how we come up and organize our events and about how we simply love working as a team and becoming a family.

      </p>    
      <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
      Next, it came the time for the demonstrative matches, we checked our robot for one last time and hanged it on the lander. It went pretty well, our efforts from the previous days paying off, Lori, as we named the robot last season, did its job and showed why it got to the World Championship. After the match ended, all the teams thanked Inorog Team for the invitation and we assured them that we will continue collaborating with them and that we will help them with everything they needed and mentoring them.

      In late March-April, one of our collaborators, a person really dear to us, Crina Luha, that was also one of our XeoTalks speakers since the beginning, invited to be a speaker. She was impressed by our work over time and wanted to make our experience even more public. 

      </p>    
      <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
      The theme for this year’s TEDx was Untangling Chaos, which comparing our team, we realized it’s very fitting. The theme wanted to express how so many things in our lives seem chaotic but, with great ambition and love, we can “untangle” it.

      </p>    
      <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
      One night of hard work and the 15 minute speech was ready to be sent to Crina to give us tips and further corrections. 

      </p>    
      <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
      The speech that we made was about Self-Learning, and how we succeeded to compete and win in a robotics competition – even though this particular field is not taught to us in schools and we has to teach ourselves.

     <p>      At the beginning of the season, while everyone was still processing the new theme and waiting for the robot parts kits, we thought it would be a good opportunity to focus on outreach and create an event so FTC teams could come to our city. We also had to think of ideas pretty fast so we could plan it before other teams’DEMO events. </p>
     <p>      But what could we do at the beginning of the season? It was too early for hosting a DEMO because people were just starting to build the robots, the ones that received the kits.</p>
     <p>      Our idea was born from a casual conversation while on a car ride home between Alex and Maria. We could prepare teams for what’s coming next by inviting speakers from different fields like marketing, PR, programming and robot assembly, giving the teams an extra special head start. </p>
     <p>      We discussed with the whole team about the idea and they were pretty excited about it so we jumped into it. It was pretty exciting because the tech let the non-tech take full control on the event and followed our tasks.</p>
     <p>      The schedule itself was not really easy to make because we had  problems squeezing in coffee breaks and some more fun activities that were added at the last minute and this gave us a little headache but we managed to go over it somehow. Of course our schedule had a lot of versions and went through a lot of modifications. Despite all that, we are really proud of the diversity of the topics we included in the schedule.</p>
     <p>      All of the modifications and constant communication with our speakers all the way from Bucharest: Ioan Istrate and Sorin Badea. They also involved personally by talking about this year’s challenges, game manual and many other tips and tricks.</p>
     <p>      After all the teams arrived we took them on a short trip to the University where the conferences were gonna take place. The route school-university walked you through a tiny bit of our famous citadel, this way showing off with our precious places.</p>
     <p>      Once we arrived in the room, our school’s representative opened the ceremony with some nice words and congratulated us and everybody in the room for what we are organizing and taking a part of. </p>
     <p>      We were glad to have presented with us two important and inspiring women that represent Natie Prin Educatie – our local FTC organizers – Gabriela Ivan and Ana Mihaela Popescu. They opened the speech by presenting the basic concept of this year’s theme.</p>
     <p>      Ciprian Cucu started the conferences officially with a simple topic but essential in this completion. Teamwork where you can have arguments, you work together, you spend a lot of your time together so we thought you should know how important it is to have good chemistry with your team.</p>
     <p>      Now the day is followed with a speech held by our local FTC organizers, talking about important points to consider this year, like the fact that there will exist Regional Competitions that are eliminatory and only afterwards you get to the National Competition, unlike last season. Also, more news include having team markers and the new scoring system.</p>
     
     <p>      Ioan Istrate had an eye-opening conference, where he talked about the benefits of his award-winning project XPrize. He has a really big amount of experience from all over the world, constantly travelling from one side of the world to another. And so, he shared most of this experience with us which left us all very fascinated. He also presented us with more gadgets that he encountered along his journey.</p>
     <p>      We can all still remember how fun and entertaining Sorin Badea’s conference was! His experience talking on the radio Guerrilla, where he works right now, really showed off. He talked to us about how schools usually portray wrong idea science and how awesome it really is. He told us about his experience in school, where he hated science and the second he saw it from another view he loved. He is now in charge of science rubric at radio Guerrilla, insisting on the fact that if someone has a great idea to share, we can always send him an email and he’ll look it up and invite us to share it live on the radio.</p>
     <p>      This was more of a technical conference in which Adrian Roșian talked about the benefits of Functional Programming. It was a bit to digest but he has succeeded in conveying the idea in a fun and friendly way. He also shared some great programming tips along the way that you see helped you see your code from another point of view.</p>
     <p>      Next up we had a really nice moment with one our mentor Sebastian Onac. He talked to us about why our generation would be more advantaged to remain in our country and not to go work abrades. He had a very beautiful and sincere speech telling the journey from the first season to the actual one, describing all the feelings our team has been through. One quote that stood out was “you are the least manipulable population out there” and that we need to take advantage of that. Afterwards he asked our whole team to come in front because he wanted to stand beside us. Then Alex, ex team leader and now our mentor held a speech encouraging others to stay in the competition even after you can't be a team member anymore. Pop and Mihai also held a speech telling everyone how much FTC helped him evolve.</p>
     <p>      Next up we had a surprise guest, Wizards.exe! Last year’s Inspire Award Winner at the First World Championship Detroit. We had a live chat where they shared with us their experience thought the competition, their perspective on outreach, when planning for awards, etc. After they showed us the videos they answered questions from the audience. It was a really wholesome chat overall and they were open to replay to further questions in private from others teams.</p>
     <p>      The last conference of the day was by Crina Luha. She impressed us with an amazing conference about branding. It was one of the most interactive conferences. Crina started by asking about what we thought personal branding was. Then, she asked every team to choose an animal that would represent us the best, a motto and a pair of a superhero and villain. Then she told us the meaning of each and continued with a series of tips for branding our team like being very active on social media and staying true to our principles.</p>
     <p>      On the second day everyone was a bit tired because of the other night's party but they were also very excited about what was coming next. </p>
     
     
     <p>      *100 de motive pentru care #roboticaunesteromania" = 100 reasons why #roboticsuniteomania</p>
     <p>       For the last day, we decided to open the day by sharing our opinion on why robotics unite Romania. Each of us shared their personal opinion and then we gave the microphone to the audience for them to share their own personal opinions or answer us what robotics means to them.</p>
     
     <p>      After a day full of conferences we felt like all of us deserve a break so the Halloween party was the perfect medicine. Because it was close to the 31st of October, we chose the 'Halloween theme and decided to make the place look like a true Haunted House. So we assigned this task to our team member, Alexandra, our trusty artist. So she gathers up a crew of people to help her, a "DIY" team, and starts working on some 'magical' and 'scary' confections skeletons, fairy lights, some jars with 'potion' ingredients and some little spooky ghosts.</p>
    
     <p>      After this wholesome experience the conferences kept going with lonel Doboacă - Game Manual He explained us very detailed about certain aspects of the game manual and why every team should have one team member that knows the game manual by heart. Sorin Badea joined the conversation and reinforced his idea. He also gave us ideas to take in consideration for the latching systems and many others.</p>
     
     <p>      Following, we took a break from the conference to go outside and have a pumpkin contest organized by our energizar volunteers. The rules were simple: we put a bunch of tools on a table and each had certain points. We wrote down what every team took and then we gave them half an hour to get creative and make the best pumpkin.</p>
     
     <p>      Florin Râşteiu is CAB Project Management Florin was one of the people that helped us a lot in organizing the event because he himself has organized a lot of events. And so, we asked him to talk about a topic that brings headaches to some teams: CAB Project Management and tips for getting sponsors. His speech was very full of confidence and straight forward, a lot of people asked him further questions and shared their experiences, offering everyone another point of view and other  methods of approaching possible sponsors.</p>
     
     <p>      Claudiu Ceia talked about his experience working at a company that was insolvent and every employee was demoralized working on small projects and doing routine work, but later he had the opportunity to work for Facebook where he had developed solutions for dynamic problems, changing the everyday life of 1 billion people.</p>
     <p>      Mihai Oltean presented us his robot Jenny5, that he made from scratch, inspired from the SF movies he saw as a kid. He plans further to create more humanoid robots. His technical conference lasted more than it should, yet people kept putting him questions after the conference.</p>
     
     <p>      Robo Virtual Labs" Flavia Cristea, Andrei Eduard Rus, Ovidiu luonas. They came in as our last conference and they talked about a project they're working on : a platform where you can modify the code of a robot from everywhere.</p>
     
     <p>      Next on the schedule should've been the Treasure Hunt but we ended up with a two hour delay and teams needed to leave. This was a real bummer for us but we tried to conclude everything nicely. Unfortunately, the volunteers that helped us with the energizers prepared hints all around the citadel for the Treasure Hunt and we had a few arguments. In order to apology, Mihai, our team leader, apologized to them and he took them out to eat on our team's bill as a sign of gratitude for everything they did for us.</p>

        On the Ist of March, at 6 am. we all left for the regional competition at Cluj. There, our first thought was to make the robot inspection, where we met Razvan Cionca, Roxana Popeiu and Adam George, our former team members, who were volunteers for this stage of the competition.

      </p>
      <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
        The second thing we did was to build our pit, with the retro theme, we put vinyl discs on the walls and we even transformed one in our logo. We also put an old TV on which we showed the message "Coming soon", as a clue to what we were going to do at Bucharest, if we would qualificate, our idea for the national stage was to have as theme retro games. Another clue abeut what we were going to do was Mario, our mascot. Anyway, after we finished with the pit, we all went to talk with our friends from the other teams and with our former team members, which we hadn t seen for a long time, all of them being volunteers, Alex Dragus and Pop Cristian being even FTA and referee.

      </p>  
      <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
        Scond day came. And, like that, the first day passed, and the matchday came. We woke up early in order to arrive in time at the drivers meeting and to check the robot for the last time before the matches would start.

      </p>  
      <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
        While all the matches were being played and everyone was stressed, our mascot did its job and made people put a smile on their faces, inviting them to hit a question mark box with their heads to get a special surprise, a chocolate coin, like in the old Mario Bros game.

      </p>  
      <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
        Also, during the matches, because a lot of teams had problems with their autonomies, Sofrac offered to help them and he really a great job, fixing the autonomies from three teams.

      </p>  
      <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
        The last day...With a quite cold morning and a clear, blue sky, we started the third day of the regional competition. As the last match that was being played was ours and as we knew that this was our chance to get in the top positions, we wanted to be sure that everything was as it should be, so we tested the autonomies and the robots one last time before we went to the playing field, waiting for our match to start.

      </p>  
      <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
        At the end of the day, we found out that we qualified for the national stage and we were very happy.

        It all started when it came the idea to one of us to buy a van, the "Xeo van". Because we travel a lot together as a teag and usually transport is expensive for everyone when we rent a minibus, we thought that would be a good idea, but rather difficult to apply. We think of everything, the color (Xeo blue, definelly!), wheels with the team logo and obviously one seat for each team member. Although we thought of all the details, the costs to buy a van were over our budget, so we gave up the idea, but not totally.

      </p>  
      <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
        It's been a while since we dropped the "Xeo van" idea, but on November 27th we have taken part in the global giving movement "Giving Tuesday '' . Then how enthusiastic kids were about the competition, about informatics and about building a robot. That day we reached 3 classes, each with 25-30 little students. We decided that this activity must continue, but this time to a higher level in such a way that we can reach as many schools as possible. So what if we go to more schools? What if we can make presentations to kids from other cities from our county? And if we go through as many schools in our county, so many children find out how beautiful they can combine the passion to build robots, with teamwork and pleasure.

      </p>  
      <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
        First we need a name for this project. We've been thinking about the name of what we wanted to make in all the schools in the county for a while. One day one of us found a van for sale at a lower price, but still very high for our budget and then the idea came. The concept of the" Xeo van" was to be bought so we could travel more easily together. Exactly on the same concept as our idea for the project; we travel together from school to school from city to city to share with the little students of General Schools our passion for robots. After a meeting with all the team we decided to call it "Xeo Caravan".      

      </p>  
      <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
        The day before we went to the regional competition in Cluj we sent an email to every school we had a letter from the Mayor. In total we sent 11 emails for 11 schools from Alba lulia. Because our goal besides reaching schools from our city was to reach schools that were not from our city, some of us spoke personally to the directors of schools from Campeni, Abrud and Jidvei, being former students at those schools or knowing the directors. After we returned from Cluj on Monday, we called the school's directors to establish the days when we can go to schools to make the presentations to kids.

      <p>      As we already accustomed, the day of departure to Bucharest coincides with the last day of the 12th grade Baccalaureate simulations. We left with the legendary minibus of STP Alba. The first stop was the traditional one, making the first group photo of this weekend in the Olt Valley gas station.</p>

      <p>      Arriving at the Polyvalent Hall, we unloaded the materials, the structural elements of the team’s pit and we started to build it up. For this season we have chosen to present ourselves at the contest under the aura of Retro theme (imitative of a style or fashion from the recent past).</p>
      
      <p>      Friday. Since morning, we have enjoyed many visitors to the team stand. Over 2000 retro arcade games and a banner full of figures defining our activity this season are the main topics of discussion.</p>
      
      <p>      The first moment of the day, and one of the most important points of the weekend, was the jury interview. After we went through the Robot Inspection and the Field Inspection, we headed to the training grounds to make the last adjustments for the robot’s autonomy, and to accommodate the atmosphere of the Polyvalent Hall.</p>
      
      <p>      Saturday came and we found the order of the matches.After analyzing the composition of the Vlaicu division and the alliances that we have in the qualifying matches, the scouting teams went into recognition and the drivers and the coach began to set the game strategies suited to each match.</p>
      
      <p>      Inspired by the electriant atmosphere, we organised a treasure hunt, hiding several thematic badges throughout the entire area accessible to the teams. The rarest and most precious badges were the ones with Mario, our mascot this year.</p>
      
      <p>      Among the confrontation of the robots, to which our gallery was on the frontline, we had a series of surprise guests. </p>
      
      <p>      After a day with 3 or 4 games won, we met again with old friends, a lot of questions from the new ones, moments of nostalgia, but especially of hope, we ended our day with optimism, centalizing scouting data building an ELO score for each team in our division after the algorithm created by our colleague ALexandru.</p>
      
      <p>      The last day, sunday, began with an energy boost for us. FIRST US President, Don Bossi visits the team’s pit, wishing us success. We were honored. </p>
      
      <p>      We are very happy to see the happiness in the eyes of the winners, and we proudly remember moments of this season in which we collaborated with the parents of the 77 robot, the one who impressed the entire audience.</p>
      
      <p>      Award ceremony starts! The song “Perfect fara tine” was ringing through the speakers, which makes us abandon our seats and go to the front of the stage, singing and living the moment at full intensity.</p>
      
      <p>      We were delighted to see many new award winning teams! For the 1st place Control Award, Ionut Budisteanu made a brief description of the winner: “Well, 1st place goes to a team as predestined… Team RO001 Xeo, HCC National College Alba Iulia!” We look at each other and say nothing. Then we realize what was going on, start yelling, and get on stage.</p>
      
      <p>      The last prize to be awarded is the Inspire Award. The Key of the FIRST community, encompass all aspects of the team, from our way of being, to our way of organizing, to work, to the innovative ideas with which we come in construction of the robot or the way we described our journey in the technical book.</p>
      
      <p>      We’re waiting and we’re full of emotions and them, we’re hearing…</p>
      
      <p>      “Second Place goes to RO001 Xeo team, from the National College of HCC Alba Iulia,”</p>
      
      <p>      We did it. We feel the emotion in our eyes, shaking and the joy of the soul, which seems to remain silent. We go down near the stage and we can’t take too many steps. We cry tears of joy!</p>

      Our journey has begun! The long-awaited day has arrived! We're all very excited to go to Detroit
      again to represent our country at the world championship.
      After a 6-hour bus trip, we arrived at the hotel where
      we were going to stay one night until we left for the
      airport. That night was a pretty short one. At 3 am we
      woke up because we had to get in time to the airport.
      There we met with all three teams and with Natie Prin
      Educatie team.
      After about 10 hours of flight, we landed in Detroit.
      Because of the time zone in Detroit it was morning, although in Romania it was evening.
      We went to rent cars so we could get to the hotel and the first thing we did was go buy the
      necessary materials for our competition pit from Lowe’s, a diy shop that was right behind our
      hotel. Also on the first day we went to Walmart to buy things with which we could build mini-
      games to play with the teams at the pit.
      The first day had passed, and the next day the girls took care to prepare the mini-games for the
      pit, and the boys went to COBO Center to prepare the pit. For the mini-games we also did a
      “Menu” for the games with every game that everyone could play at our stand. We had games
      like: Pin the mustache, Facepaint, the treasure hunt with the custom pins and the main attraction
      Glitter shower.
      On the first day of the competition we woke up in the morning because we were an hour away
      from the COBO center where the competition was held. The first day is a special one because on
      the first day besides some matches and robot inspection teams also have interviews with the
      judges. For the first day we also chose the outfit with the Xeo hoodie and the black T-shirts.
      Then it followed robot inspection we did pretty good. The
      atmosphere was very loose and we had a great time at the
      robot inspection. After robot inspection we had the
      interview. Just as at robot inspection there was an
      atmosphere and besides the things that were related to the
      competition everyone was curious to know more about our country and all the competitions we
      participated in. In the same day, in the evening we had a few matches. We've prepared a lot for
      the competition, and the assembly team has taken care of the robot so that it's in its best shape.

      For the second day we had prepared something really interesting, the outfit was with our Xeo
      NASA T-shirts and it was in the style of 50’s with jeans jackets and red lipstick for the girls but
      that was not all. We all dyed our hair with blue sprays which of course were not permanent but
      they lasted the whole day.

      As we said we had some mini-games at our pit and one of them was the treasure hunt that we
      organized at the national competition in Romania too, the one with the custom pins.
      Later on that day we took part of FIRST Welcome party organized at Ford Field. It’s always a
      pleasure to meet with other teams from FIRST Tech Challenge. We did a lot of friends there and
      from the photo booth to the scene to sing karaoke we participated in all the activities that were
      there.

      On the third day our outfits were more lickely 90’s fashion, we had windbreaker jackets and the
      T-shirt made by our graphician with a famous old rock from Romania called “The Sphinx”. Our
      whole pit that day was very colorful. Everyone was full of glitter and color.
      At lunch break we decided to visit the city and we took the subway. But this subway was a little
      bit unusual because it was not underground it was actually above the whole city.

      Last day of the competition… Before we left the COBO Center we shared with all the people
      who were in the FTC and FRC small brochures competitions that we received from the City
      Hall. The brochures were about our city with different curiosities and pictures of the City
      Fortress.
      After the award ceremony at COBO center all the teams from all FIRST competitions went to
      Ford Field stadium because that's where the finals of the FIRST Tech Challenge and the FIRST
      Robotics Competition were played.
      We were all very excited because we never
      participated in a final played on an entire stadium
      before. The tension was in the air, because the teams
      playing finals and their supporters were very excited.
      We had the pleasure of meeting a FRC team that also
      won the World championship last season.

      28/04/2019

      Easter holidays were in Romania while we were in
      America. Like a gift from Easter Bunny we took a trip to
      Chicago which is the largest city in the state of Illinois and
      the third largest city in the United States.
      On 30 th of April we went to visit with all the teams at
      University of Michigan. There a Romanian student from
      the University was our guide. We've been introduced to
      the entire university campus. We've seen where students

      work, where they learn, the library and the halls where they spend their free time.
      We left Detroit on the 1 st of May and we have got home in Romania on the 2 nd of May because of
      the time zone. After we landed on the Romanian land went to the bus because from Bucharest is
      6 hours apart from Alba Iulia. When we arrived at our school all of our parents and friends were
      there to surprise us. It was probably one of the most beautiful surprises that we have ever got and
      we wanted to thank to all of out families and friends that made that possible.

      The awaited day has come! Today we were beginning our travel to Wolfsburg where we were going to visit one of the largest car builder companies, Volkswagen. We were all very excited because we were going to spend the next four days in one of the most famous cities in Germany due to the Volkswagen company. 

      </p>  
      <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
      Even though a week ago we had just returned from the US from the World Championship our parents began to be very emotional until the bus left the school yard. This time we were even more excited because we found out that in Bucharest we have a film crew waiting for us. They were going to make a video of our entire experience in Germany. This video was to be transmitted to one of the largest local televisions in the SuperSPEED show. Also, the hosts of the show were with us in Germany too, to be able to film the dedicated episode of the entire experience in Germany. 

      </p>  
      <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
      We arrived at the airport where we were greeted by Costin Giurgea and Tudor Bratu the hosts of the show and we had already begun to draw the first frames for the video. We talked a little bit with them about our team and we all were very excited because none of us went to Wolfsburg before. They said that they are going in Germany, besides visiting the company and the city along with us, to make a drive test at Autostadt, one of the biggest Volkswagen museums.      

      </p>  
      <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
      After two flights we’ve got to the airport from Hannover, Wolfsburg being a small town doesn’t have an airport and from there we took a special bus ready for us and in about one hour we were in Wolfsburg.

      </p>      ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
      <h5>First day – AutoMuseum Volkswagen</h5>
      <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
      First day started right after we landed on Germany, we went to visit the AutoMuseum. AutoMuseum Volkswagen is an automobile museum in Wolfsburg. Opened in April 1985, it is one of two museums in Wolfsburg devoted to the history of the Volkswagen brand, the other is at nearby Autostadt which we visited in the last day.

      </p>  
      <h5>The second day – VW Factory</h5>
      <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
      The second day was reserved for visiting the Volkswagen factory. The tour was a private one and because of this we could not shoot or take pictures. The only photo we have is the one that our guide took for us and being the only one is really special for us.  

      </p>  
      <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
      The factory tour began with one of the engineers from Volksvagen who talked  about the digitisation process and presented us with the differences between digitisation and automation. There's been talk of some problems that we've been trough over the years and also everyone needs digitisation because it helps greatly in streamlining processes.

      </p>  
      <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
      As a team, after the presentation, we’ve learned how to organize on a semidigitalized structure and how to improve all processes that are not quite effective made by people.

      </p>  
      <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
      It followed the visit to Volkswagen IT:CITY. The presentation in IT city was very impressive because of all the robots and all the equipment they had at their disposal. We saw that they code in Java, and the our programmers have managed to understand some of their programming language. 

      </p>  

      <h5>The third and last day – Autostadt</h5>
      <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
      The day began with a visit to a museum of cars called Autostadt which has cars made by Volkswagen and collaborators and also competitors’s vehicles. We saw the beginnings of the automobile industry and it’s clearly that everything was born in Germany. We had the chance to see cars that we saw on the internet and we didn't think we'd ever get to see them.

      </p>  
      <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
      We've visited the towers where all the cars leaving Wolfsburg are kept. They are fully automated and can be stored at least 400 cars in a very small place. These towers have more elevators, and we've been in a booth and these elevators have climbed us up the same way all the cars climb. 

      </p>  
      <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
      While we were climbing the elevator in the tower, Giurgea and Bratu who are the hosts of the show SuperSPEED, did a test drive along with two of our teammates. After they came back from test drive they told us that the trip was fun but also impressive because it feels different to see some tests drive compared to when you are in a car that can go with a certain speed and being and very performance too.

      </p>  
      <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
      The entire experience in Autostadt is made to create a connection between the buyer and the seller. Clients come here to take the cars, go somewhere sign some paperwork, meanwhile an automatic little robot comes with the license plates all over the campus. Customers put their license plates on the car and then stay at night at the hotel on campus and the next day they leave by car. 

      </p>  
      <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
      At the end of the day we had to shoot the latest sequences for the video... Unfortunately one of the most beautiful experiences was about to end… We've got to the bridge that lies above the river that passes through Wolfsburg which is also next to the Volkswagen factory. It was a wonderful sunset, and the production team managed to shoot the most beautiful images.

      </p>

      This year's situation was one... different. We met something new, unfortunately not pleasant and we have to learn to live with it. However, the first to have contact with the new virus were doctors. They carry the fight for the recovery, for everyone to be safe and we decided to help them, within our powers, if not close, at least from a distance. So, together with the teams from all over the country, we mobilized ourself in Alba Iulia and, with the only printer we had at our disposal, we started printing visors. We started with lower requirements from the most affected place, the Infectious Disease Hospital where we were able to get 80 views in a short time. More than 100 visits donated to the Alba County Emergency Hospital and the COFID And DSP Alba Laboratories Teams followed. We had the 3D model of the visors, what we needed were more people to put their printers to work so we announced on our social media accounts that we give the model to anyone who is willing to help. And so collaborations followed with people from Alba Iulia who had personal printers and they also started printing. We also received help from our community, and from the CTC Store, which helped us by donating the protective film. The employees of Alba Iulia Municipality did not let themselves down and helped us to purchase the material needed to make the visors. We also managed to make our work known outside the FTC community, by participating in a video report by Laurentiu Ungureanu and Ionut Duinea for Recorder.ro, where we were invited along with other robotics teams from the country to talk about the help we could give to the doctors on the front line. We had a break period, during which our services were no longer necessary, but it seems that the situation is getting worse again and we started again to manufacture visors, this time for the House of Varstini dun Barabant, where the nurses need the best protection.

      Robots to the rescue was a world wide competition which was hosted by PTC and had teams from different countries think about 3D modelled robots that were able to solve real world problems. Every robot gained points after a specific criteria that was based on creativity, design process, functionality, and real-life utility, bonus points being awarded to those teams who cooperated with other teams to create their robots together.

      <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
      We paired up with team RO186 The Resistance and, after some meetings at which we discussed what we could do and the actual way of transforming our ideas into reality, we got to the theme of cleaning the sea waters and shores of trash. We decided that we would design the water debris collecting robot and they would design the other one, as we already had an idea regarding this one. So, after we designed the base floating part of the robot, we got to the trash collecting and smashing mechanism and, as we knew that the regular FTC dimensions wouldn’t be enough, we designed a moving wall inside the robot that would orientate the garbage that was going inside of the robot to a certain place and, from that moment, the wall was starting to apply pressure on the debris and, from the walls, some sharp blades would start to go out and cut through the plastic so that it could be pressured more than by only getting some air out of it. Then, the pressured trash would be lifted into a compartment mounted on linear slides, which would then extend as far as 2 meters, to be able to deliver the trash to our partners on the shore, as they would collect it by standing under the compartment and it being rotated to 90 degrees so that it could be emptied.

      In the end we had to make a little manual of our robot that described it and it’s use, that helped us get to the 36 place at the competition out of 400 si ceva teams that entered in this competition.

      In 2020 DevTalks has reached A new dimension thought DevTalks Reimagined, bringing together this year more than 4000 participants.

      </p>  
      <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
      On 10-12th of June we participated at the biggest DevTalks edition with a premade 3D modeled pit, for which we needed to make visuals that represents our team. Alongside our visuals we prepared 2 videos: one that made a brief description of us and another one that was the one to describe our 4th season robot, the Black Mamba. It took 2 weeks to prepare for this, days in which we gathered at one of our friends home and worked from morning till night to make sure that our robot reaches the wanted design, the videos are ready to represent us and the 3D model of our robot is impressing everyone.

      </p>  
      <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
      On the first day we were very excited to see that there were so many pits every pit with it’s own unique design. Some of them even had quizzes and games after which you had the chance of winning prizes. In the next two days we simply enjoyed the conferences and had a great time.

      </p>  
      <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
      Three days full of joy in which we got the chance of showing the people our work, our progress in 4 years and our passion for what we do. We sure hope to get the chance to participate in the next editions and spread our values with as many people as we can.

      Our idea to create a Discord server was inspired by the teams from the United States, which actually use this type of communication method to organize events, play games, and even to discuss and design robot ideas, all while sharing them with the other teams. At first, we thought about starting an international discord server, but we quickly realized that there were too many and that we wouldn’t come with anything new, so we decided to create one for all the Romanian teams. To simplify the process of creating it, at first, we gave instructions to two bots that would later do everything automated, giving them things to do as welcoming people, giving them all the info that they would need to know when they join the server, and even playing music if called with the right commands. The next step was to create a role for and every team and with a little over 200 roles ending up being created for them and some extra roles for the organizers of the competition. The next thing was to introduce the role of the server, we did that by creating special voice and text channels for every department, from mechanics to PR, while also adding gaming and meme channels, just so that we would be able to communicate more with the other teams, while also having a lot of fun in the process.

      </p>  
      <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
      Next, we had to clarify what we clearly wanted to do on the server, so we decided to have meetings from time to time with the rest of the teams, discussing everyone’s progress and well-being. Another thing that we wanted to offer was monthly meetings with speakers that could help the teams in different domains and to also organize some of our events here.

      </p>  
      <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
      For the official launch of the server on the 11th of September, we invited two speakers: Crina Luha and Cornel Amariei, They thought us about the importance of believing in your dream, in your powers and in the fact that everything is possible.

      </p>  
      <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
      The next meeting was a week later, as we discussed with the rest of the teams their robot ideas and we watched some videos of some robot in 3 days designs to break them down and learn some more about how we could assembly specific systems. 

      </p>  
      <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
      After this, we continued to use the server for having occasional gaming evenings with some of the other teams and to still discuss ideas whenever we felt like it.

      Already for us, Flight Festival is a traditional event.  This year, we had the pleasure of participating, in the second edition of our favorite festival in Timisoara, from 4-6 September. It was three hot days of summer but we managed to feel, after a long time spent in quarantine, that we had fun this summer. Of course, we didn't lack protection, we took every measure to keep the virus away from us even though we're far from home. 

      </p>  
      <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
      Flight Festival is an event based on music but does not forget to highlight art or technology. Also this year we represented the bastion of technology with our dear friends from Timisoara, Team CSH, and the team from Arad, Delta Force.

      </p>  
      <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
      We wanted to capture the audience as much as possible so our stand was filled with interactive activities for children and adults, being also safe for health. 

      </p>  
      <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
      One of the main attractions was our 3D printer which constantly prints a model so that viewers can observe its mode of action. 

      </p>  
      <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
      At the same time, with the help of sensors that functioned based on sensors we were able to offer promotional materials printed 3d, robots, and airplanes, without us or the public being in contact with them. 

      </p>  
      <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
      On the same topic, our stand also had a robotic arm that tracks the movements of the hand with the help of a Kinect and the children were very excited about it. 

      </p>  
      <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
      To further energize the atmosphere, for football enthusiasts we also had a table on which 2 robots controlled with the help of the personal phone competed in as many goals they could. 

      </p>  
      <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
      Also, we have not forgotten to spread the values of FIRST, bringing with us a small part of our competition We didn't want to leave home either the playing field or the robot, so we brought them with us and made a few demonstration matches with the other teams.

      </p>  
      <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎
      This year, Flight Festival has brought us even more. We had the opportunity to participate, two days in a row, in Tech Talks conferences, where we met wonderful people from whom we learned how to start a business, or how with one idea, we can build something great.
